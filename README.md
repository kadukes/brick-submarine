# Brick Submarine

This project contains a collection of circuit python scripts used in a raspberry pi in order to run a small autonomous underwater vehicle. This project is currently work in progress and not finished by far. Main parts of the project were inspired by a series of blog entries from a finnish creator called "Brick Experiment Channel" which can be found here: https://brickexperimentchannel.wordpress.com/.

My goal is to adapt the ideas in that blog and to overcome the limits it has by its current design.
